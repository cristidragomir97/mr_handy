Selected: Refrigerator040, Stove066, GlassCup008 and HoneyBottle002. Source models
are unchanged; prepared XML scales cup/bottle geometry to 45%, inserts computed
inertials, and the scene namespaces identifiers and adapts collision masks.
`manifest.json` records the pinned revision and SHA256 provenance. Downloads and
selected source/prepared files are cached locally by scripts/setup-world-assets.sh.

The custom room/furniture layout is authored in handy101_mujoco/worlds/home.xml.
